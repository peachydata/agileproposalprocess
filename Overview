1. Problem Statement: Current rigid proposal processes are arbitrary in nature. They promote outputs rather than outcomes. "Did you check the box yet?" Rather than, "how close are we to telling a story that matters?" 

2. Vision: Develop a process for small to midsize traditional government proposals and non-traditional government proposals (e.g. SBIRs, BAAs, OTAs, etc) that accommodate a more flexible process to prioritize PWIN and success over arbitrary phases.

3. Strategy: Create a flexible process that simplifies the flow of information, delivery ownership, and product submission by automating compliance outlining, customer insight collection, and content creation through rapid collaboration and a culture of "shared ownership".
